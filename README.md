Data Generation & Feature Engineering:
We simulate a dataset using make_classification and create a DataFrame with clinically relevant features. Two additional features (high_dosage and impaired_kidney) are engineered to capture specific risk factors.

Model Training:
Both logistic regression and random forest models are trained. Cross-validation (5-fold) is used to ensure the models generalize well.

Evaluation:
ROC AUC scores are calculated on both the cross-validation folds and the test set. Classification reports provide detailed performance metrics (precision, recall, f1-score) for each class.

Clinical Impact:
By incorporating this risk assessment model into a clinical decision support system:

Early Identification: Clinicians can quickly identify patients at high risk for adverse side effects.
Tailored Treatment: High-risk patients may receive adjusted medication dosages, alternative treatments, or enhanced monitoring.
Improved Outcomes: Proactive risk management can lead to reduced incidence of adverse events, improving patient safety and overall treatment outcomes.
